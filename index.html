    <h4>Ecology experts have assessed the effectiveness of planting trees to combat climate change. They called the afforestation process pointless, as it takes a long time for plants to become "efficient carbon stores." It is reported by Dezeen.

        The publication learned the opinion of experts on afforestation as a way to "capture" carbon in the atmosphere. According to experts, forests become capable of retaining a harmful substance at least ten years after planting. To achieve the desired effect, plantings must be looked after for decades.“So you plant young trees and then you have to maintain them for a hundred years. These are several generations of people. How many companies have been operating for a hundred years today? How can anyone afford to maintain this forest by hiring a dedicated team to do it? It makes no sense,” said Nori CEO Paul Gambrill. <br>

        Experts stressed that trees are cut down, using as fuel, and fires can occur in forests. As a result, due to the processes of decay and combustion, the accumulated carbon is quickly returned to the atmosphere. Experts urged to find more sustainable methods and plant trees wisely to create a balanced ecosystem. Interface spokesman Jon Khoo proposed an integrated approach - planting mangrove forests and algae, as well as using special mechanisms to capture carbon dioxide from the air.
        
        Earlier, the Norwegian oil company Equinor was concerned about carbon capture. It has announced plans to triple the UK's hydrogen production by building the world's largest clean fuel industrial complex. The plant will operate special technologies for capturing and storing harmful substances.
